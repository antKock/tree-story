# Story 3.4: Story Reader — Prose & Choice Cards

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a player,
I want to read story paragraphs and tap a choice to advance the narrative,
so that the experience feels like reading a well-designed article that forks — not like playing a game.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `ParagraphDisplay` renders the paragraph's `content` as flowing prose in 20px Lora, left-aligned, 1.72 line-height, `max-width: 65ch`
2. Prose supports markdown-lite inline formatting: `**bold**` and `*italic*` — no other markdown syntax
3. No chapter markers, section headers, or paragraph IDs are visible to the player
4. `ChoiceCards` renders each choice as a full-width card stacked vertically below the prose block with: `border-radius: 8px`, `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`, `padding: 16px 20px`, `min-height: 48px` (NFR7)
5. Tapping a card calls `resolveChoice(choiceId)` — no confirmation dialog, no delay
6. The next paragraph renders within 200ms of the tap (NFR1)
7. Prose and choice cards share the same scroll container — no split-scroll, no floating bottom bar
8. `StoryReader.tsx` is the sole consumer of `useStoryEngine` — all children receive engine state as props only

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `components/ParagraphDisplay.tsx` (AC: 1–3)
  - [ ] Props: `{ content: string }`
  - [ ] Render in a `<div>` with class `.prose` (Lora, 20px, 1.72 line-height) from globals.css
  - [ ] Apply markdown-lite rendering for `**bold**` → `<strong>` and `*italic*` → `<em>`:
    ```typescript
    function renderMarkdownLite(text: string): React.ReactNode[] {
      // Split on **bold** and *italic* patterns
      // Return array of React nodes: strings, <strong>, <em>
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Simple regex approach (no markdown library needed):
    - Replace `**text**` with `<strong>text</strong>`
    - Replace `*text*` with `<em>text</em>` (careful: don't match `**` as italic)
  - [ ] No paragraph IDs, section numbers, or metadata visible to player
  - [ ] `max-width: 65ch; padding: 0 1.5rem` for reading column

- [ ] Create `components/ChoiceCards.tsx` (AC: 4–6)
  - [ ] Props: `{ choices: Choice[]; onChoiceSelect: (choiceId: string) => void }`
  - [ ] Map over `choices` to render each as a `<button>`:
    ```css
    border-radius: 8px;
    border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
    padding: 16px 20px;
    min-height: 48px;
    width: 100%;
    text-align: left;
    background: var(--color-surface);
    color: var(--color-text-primary);
    font-family: var(--font-lora); /* prose-like for choice text */
    ```
  - [ ] `onClick={() => onChoiceSelect(choice.id)}`
  - [ ] No confirmation dialog — immediate action on tap
  - [ ] Stack vertically with `gap: 8px` between cards
  - [ ] 200ms render target: since `resolveChoice` is synchronous in the engine, React re-render should happen immediately after state update (well under 200ms)

- [ ] Create `components/StoryReader.tsx` — the root client component (AC: 7, 8)
  - [ ] `"use client"` directive — this component manages engine state
  - [ ] Props: `{ config: StoryConfig }`
  - [ ] **Sole consumer of `useStoryEngine`**: `const { engineState, resolveChoice, applyDecay } = useStoryEngine(config)`
  - [ ] Local state: `const [charSheetOpen, setCharSheetOpen] = useState(false)`
  - [ ] Layout structure:
    ```tsx
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', minHeight: '100vh' }}>
      <GaugeStrip
        gauges={engineState.gauges}
        config={config}
        onOpenCharacterSheet={() => setCharSheetOpen(true)}
      />
      <main style={{ flex: 1, overflowY: 'auto' }}>
        <div className="reading-column">
          <ParagraphDisplay content={currentParagraph.content} />
          {!engineState.isGameOver && !engineState.isComplete && (
            <ChoiceCards
              choices={currentParagraph.choices}
              onChoiceSelect={resolveChoice}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </main>
      <CharacterSheet
        open={charSheetOpen}
        onClose={() => setCharSheetOpen(false)}
        engineState={engineState}
        config={config}
      />
      {(engineState.isGameOver || engineState.isComplete) && (
        <EndScreen engineState={engineState} config={config} onReplay={resetEngine} />
      )}
    </div>
    ```
  - [ ] Apply `applyDecay` at decay nodes: check if `engineState.paragraphId` is in `config.decayNodes` — if so, call `applyDecay()` in a `useEffect` when `paragraphId` changes
  - [ ] Handle the decay timing: call `applyDecay()` AFTER the choice resolves and new paragraph renders

- [ ] Handle decay node side effect (AC: — from architecture)
  - [ ] `useEffect(() => { if (config.decayNodes.includes(engineState.paragraphId)) { applyDecay() } }, [engineState.paragraphId])`
  - [ ] Note: This fires after rendering the new paragraph at a decay node. The decay effects will cause another state update and re-render with updated gauges.

- [ ] Wire StoryReader into app flow
  - [ ] In `app/page.tsx`: render `<StoryReader config={storyConfig} />` when phase === 'story'
  - [ ] Pass validated `storyConfig` from the fetch + validate step

- [ ] Ensure scroll behavior (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Prose + choice cards are in the same `<main>` scroll container
  - [ ] GaugeStrip is sticky at top (separate from scroll area)
  - [ ] No split-scroll, no floating elements other than the gauge strip

## Dev Notes

- **`StoryReader` is the sole `useStoryEngine` consumer (critical).** From architecture: "StoryReader.tsx is the sole consumer of useStoryEngine — child components receive props only." Never import `useStoryEngine` in `GaugeStrip`, `ParagraphDisplay`, `ChoiceCards`, or any other component. Data flows as props.
- **200ms requirement (NFR1):** The pure TypeScript engine is synchronous — `resolveChoice()` runs in microseconds. The 200ms budget covers React state update + re-render + DOM paint. With React 19 and Next.js 16, this should be comfortably under budget. No special optimization needed.
- **Markdown-lite implementation:** Only `**bold**` and `*italic*` are supported. A simple regex parser is sufficient. If the prose content has `**text**`, render it as `<strong>text</strong>`. Be careful: match `**text**` before `*text*` to avoid treating bold markers as two separate italic markers.
- **Decay node timing:** Decay fires when the player ARRIVES at a decay node paragraph. The flow is: player taps choice → `resolveChoice()` → new paragraphId set → React renders new paragraph → `useEffect` fires with new paragraphId → if it's a decay node, `applyDecay()` is called → gauges update → React re-renders gauge strip. This is the correct "arrives at paragraph" semantics.
- **`isGameOver` and `isComplete` rendering:** When either is true, stop rendering `ChoiceCards` and instead show `EndScreen`. The `EndScreen` handles replay.
- **CharacterSheet integration:** `charSheetOpen` state is in `StoryReader` — it opens from GaugeStrip tap (prop callback) and closes from CharacterSheet's own close handler.

### Project Structure Notes

- `app/page.tsx` — import and render StoryReader after profile phase

Prerequisites:
- Story 2.5 (`hooks/useStoryEngine.ts`)
- Story 3.1 (design tokens)
- Story 3.3 (`GaugeStrip.tsx` — used inside StoryReader)
- Stories 3.5 and 3.6 (CharacterSheet, EndScreen — can stub initially)
